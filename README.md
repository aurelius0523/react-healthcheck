## Simple React Healthcheck Application

This is a simple CRA-bootstrapped application that makes API calls to perform healthcheck.

### Getting started :rocket:

1. run `npm install && npm start`
1. modify `api-list.json` to include resources to perform healthcheck against.

### Issues
1. Even if there's a add API functionality, it will not be easily persistable since this is a client side application.
